# SQL_restaurant_order_analysis:

This is a fun SQL project where I explored a restaurant's menu and order history to uncover insights like:
- Which dishes are most & least popular  
- Which items bring in the most revenue  
- How prices vary across categories  
- What big spenders are ordering  

The project is built around **two tables**:
1. **menu_items.csv** – details of each dish (name, category, price)
2. **order_details.csv** – details of customer orders (order ID, date, items purchased)

---

## What I Did
- Looked at the **menu** to find expensive, cheap, and category-wise dishes  
- Found **average price per category**  
- Checked **order volumes** and **most-ordered dishes**  
- Identified the **top 5 orders** that spent the most money  
- Used **JOINs** to combine order and menu data for deeper analysis  
- Broke down **high-spending orders** to see which categories were most popular
